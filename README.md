# Cryptbook.py
CryptBook is a Password Manager I built in Python3. It is capable of saving and loading passwords, encrypting them by using the cryptography library in python and is also able to generate passwords by it's own.

A side feature I added was the password strength indicator, which essentially informs the user of the strength of the password, ranging from weak to very strong.
